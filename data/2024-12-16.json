Building on this commitment, and on insights from our previous collaboration, The National Disease Registration Service and the US National Cancer Institute are working together over the next few months to explore how PETs can drive innovative research into rare paediatric cancers, through secure, privacy-preserving data collaboration between national disease registries. By using PETs, researchers can do cross-border data analysis without the need for data transfer or direct access; they can gain deeper insights without compromising data privacy. This activity is being supported by DSIT, the White House's Office for Science and Technology Policy, NIST, and the US Department of Energy, and coordinated with the National Science Foundation.",
