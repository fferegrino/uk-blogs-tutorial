This latest revision is being supported by the OCPP and was the focus of the visit kicking off with a knowledge sharing in London with the Defra Marine Species Conservation Team. The scale of the number of fishing vessels (>50,000), landing sites (>900) and sharks landed in Sri Lanka is a far cry from that of the UK and evidences the importance of a NPOA to conserve sustainable shark populations for the future. \u00a0The importance of international legislation and marrying that with national measures was discussed and will form an important pillar of the NPOA.",
