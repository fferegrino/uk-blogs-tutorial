The pioneering habitat bank we visited was proud to tell us about how the farmer and the community forms part of its management governance. Onsite, the area of improved habitat is managed by the same tenant farmer who has worked here for years.

It is easy to assume others are on the same page. This isn\u2019t always the case. We need to explain that by nature, we do of course mean wildlife and biodiversity, but we also mean how the place looks, the landscape, the aesthetics. We mean practical services, like flood management. We mean cultural and heritage aspects. We mean public access and wellbeing. The more we can blend all these elements together in our understanding of nature, how we talk about nature, and how we approach working for nature with partners, the more we maximise the value of what nature can do for all of us, and what we can do for nature.\u00a0\u00a0",
